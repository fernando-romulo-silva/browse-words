My frend studying Finnish. Now if it were I/me , I'd study English.
If I were you, I bought it.

Out of the blue
in addition to
don't bother
not only ... but also
on the fly
contents at glance

beat someone up
beat yourself up about it
blew me away
used to

get used to
fall behind
bid farewell
fall behind
Wiping out
Take place over
blew me away
I'm all for it
It is a shame!
Big eater

Over around
Take over
